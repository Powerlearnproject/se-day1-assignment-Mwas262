#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the discipline of developing ,designing and testing and mainatining  software application and systems.
It is of great importance in the technology industry since it ensures that software built is reliable,scalable,secure and efficient.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Evolution of software engineering was shaped by three major concepts:
    1.The birth of programming languages and early software development.(1940-1950)
In the early days,software was directly written in the machine code or assembly language which was highly specific to each computer architect.Creation of high level programming languages like Fortan in 1957 marked the first shift towards human reliable code. During this era, software development was a largerly adhoc process without formal methodolodies or best practices.
  2. The Advent of structured Programming and Methodologies.(1960-1970)
  Structered programming languages and software engineering methodologies were introduced. During this period, structered programming emphasized a clear,logical structure in program design using constructs like loop,conditionals, and subroutines which helped reduce complexty and improved maintainance. This period also saw the development of the water fall model in 1970 which was a linear,sequential approach towards software engineering.
    3. The rise of Agile Methodologies and Modern Software practices.(1990-2000)
    During this period,software had become increasingly complex and fast paced thus need for more adaptive and flexible methodologies. The agile manifesto in 2001 redifined software engineering by advocating for iterative development,collaboration and responsiveness to changes.Agile methodologies like scrum and extreme programming emphasized on delivering small,incremental updates,continuos customerfeedback and flexibility. Alongside the shift, practices likeDevops emerged to bridge the gap between development and operations improving deployment speed and system reliability. These changes revolutionized software development by focusing on speed ,quality and collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Gathering and analysis: This phase aims at gathering requirments fromstakeholders,clients or users. It helps understand the needs and expectations for the software and documenting them clearly.The goal is to define the scope and the functionalities of the project.
  System design: Based on the gathered requirments,the system architecture and design are creted.
  
  Implementation; Programmers write the code based on the design documents.
  
  Testing;Once the software is developed,it undergoes rigorous tests to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and is free of bugs.This includes unit testing,intergration testing and system testing and acceptance testing.The goal is to identify and fix defects before deployment.
  Deployment; After successful testing,the software will be deployed to the production environment where it becomes accesible to end users.
  
  Maintainance and support; After deployment, the software enters the maintainance phase where it is continuously monitered and updated.
  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is atraditional project management and software development approachthat follows a linear and a sequential process.Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins,and once a phase is complete,it is difficult to go back to it while Agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental approach to software development focusing on flexibility collaboration and customer feedback.The project is broken down into smaller cycles each delivering a potentially shippable product.
Waterfall would thus be appropriate when the required project is welldefined,stable and unlikely to undergo significant changes.
Agile methodologies shines in dynamic uncertain environments where customer collaboration,quick feedback,and flexibility are paramount.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: A software developer is primarily responsible for design,development and maintainance of the software application.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Focuses on ensuring the quality and functionality of the software. Their primary role is to prevent defects and ensure that the software meets the required standards.

Project manager:Responsible for overseeing the entire project,ensuring that it is delivered on time , within scoop and on budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments provides comprehensive tools for software development all intergrated in a single interface. This tools include:code editor,debugger,build automation tools and more. They help reduce errors thus increasing efficiency. They include visual sdual code,intelij etc
Version control system helps developers track and manage codes over time. Examples include;Github, Githublab and bitbucket.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1.Code quality and maintainability; writing a code that is both functional and maintainable especially as the project grows can be difficult
          Strategies;
            1.Code reviews
            2.Follow the code stardards
            3. Write clean ,modular code.
  2.Keeping up with rapid technological changes;The techlandscape evolves rapidly making it difficult to stay up to date with new tools,frameworks and languages.
           Strategies;
             1.Experiment
             2.Continuous learning
             3.Stay curious
  3.Managing time and deadlines;Balancing the demands of multiple tasks,projects and deadlines can also pose a great challange.
        Strategies;
          1.Prioritise tasks
          2.Time blocking
          3.Set realistic expectations.
  4.Debbuging complex code; this becomes challenging when the issue is buried deep into the code and the problem is not immediately apparent.
        Strategies;
            1.Breaking down the problem;
            2.Use a debugger
            3.Collaborate
            4.Write tests.
  5.Dealing with legacy code; legacy code can be hard to maintain,understand or extend especially when poorly documented or lacks tests.
        Strategy;
          1.Document changes
          2.Refactor incremently
          3.Write tests for legacy code


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing; Focuses on testing individual cmponents of the software typically at the method to ensure they work as intended.
      Importance;
        1.Early detection of bugs
        2.Improves code quality
        3.Automation
        Fast feedback.
Intergration testing; Checks how different modules or components work together.
      Importance;
        1.Reduces complex bug hunting.
        2.Detects interface isssues
        3.Confirms communication between modules.
System testing; This involves testing the entire system to ensure it works as intended.
    Importance;
      1.Ensures the software works correctly accross different environments.
      2.Ensures the entire system, including all the components and intergrations work together as expected.
Acceptance testing; This determines whether the software meets all the requirments and if its ready for deployment.
    Importance;
     1. It ensures that the software is ready to be released for production.
     2.Ensures that the software meets client expectations and is ready for use
     3.Ensures the software satisfies all business requirements and provides value to business users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the practice of crafting specific inputs or queries  to guide AI models in generation of responses.
          Importance;
            1.Accuracy; Well engineered prompts helps reduce AI to zero in on the most relevant information,minimising misunderstandings.
            2 Efficiency; Good prompt will help reduce the need of follow up questions and thus help in saving time.
           3. Improving user experience; When the prompts are well structured,AI is more likely to generate helpful,relevant and easy to understand responses.
            

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
